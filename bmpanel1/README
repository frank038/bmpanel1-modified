BMPanel is a lightweight panel with taskbar, tray, desktop switcher and clock. 
It is themeable reincarnation of fspanel. Panel should work with NETWM (aka 
EWMH) compliant window manager. Systray follows only systray-spec, KDE tray 
is not supported (cause there is standard, everything else must die).

I'm interrested in various contributions like:
 - themes
 - screenshots
 - bug report (if any) and bug fixes
 - simple feedback (what do you like and what you do not like in bmpanel)

Please send it all to no.smile.face@gmail.com. 
ATTENTION!
a) if you created theme and want to send it to me, pack it to tarball, use
file sharing service (rapidshare for example) and drop me a link.
b) if you want to send me nice screenie, you should use image sharing service
like imageshack.us (it will actually be the best choice, because imageshack
creates nice thumbnail images and I can use them on bmpanel page).

Thank you, for using bmpanel!
